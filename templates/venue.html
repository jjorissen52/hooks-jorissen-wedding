                        Awesome Hall lies within the remains of an ancient moated site, containing several medieval and post medieval timber framed and thatched barns and other traditional farm structures originally used by a wealthy farmstead.

                        </p>
 <p class="lead">
                         Awesome Hall is steeped in history. It is still possible to see where the original moat runs which pre dates most of the existing farmstead and can be seen as a large dry ditch and shallow depression and a further part is perpetuated as one of the ponds. Roman artefacts were collected by former farmer Robert Judd at Colville Hall in 1846 â€“ these dated from the 1st to the 4th centuries AD - and included coins dating from Emperors Nero to Gratian, burial urns, oil lamps and some unusually designed metal keys.
